Welcome to the C.C.I. front-end

C.C.I. : Coleco Compiler Interface

CCI is a frontend for Windows to compile ColecoVision projects.

To learn how to use CCI, you must try it by compiling a TEST file.

The following steps help you to compile the TEST.C file

- Double-click on the CCI.EXE software.
- First, select the correct Windows version
- Second, make sure the correct libraries are selected : coleco (by default) and getput 1
- Click on "COMPILE ALL" to ask for compiling every C files of this project.
- A popup window appear running 22NICE emulator
- 22NICE is waiting for a space bar to run
- The compiler compile music.c and test.c files
- The compiler create two new files : music.obj and test.obj
- To create a rom with music.obj and test.obj file, click on "LINK" button
- Another popup window appear running 22NICE emulator again
- 22NICE is waiting for a space bar to run
- See the "link>_"? The computer is waiting for the parameters
- Right-Click on the title bar of the popup window
- Choose in the popup menu to PASTE
- LINK create a result.rom file
- To test the rom file, click on "RUN" button

If all was going well, you must see a menu and a message "CONGRATULATION!" and a little music

Nice! Now, why not modifying a little bit the test.c file ?

- Open test.c file with a text editor like Notepad
- Look for a line : center_string(22,"************");
- Modify this line to replace stars by your name
- Do not use special caracters like accents
- Save the modifications
- Start CCI and configure it
- Only the test.c file was modified so you just need to re-compile this file
- Select test.c file in the File List Box and click on "COMPILE"
- A popup window appear running 22NICE emulator
- 22NICE is waiting for a space bar to run
- The compiler compile test.c file to create a test.obj file
- To create a rom with test.obj file, click on "LINK" button
- Another popup window appear running 22NICE emulator again
- 22NICE is waiting for a space bar to run
- See the "link>_"? The computer is waiting for the parameters
- Right-Click on the title bar of the popup window
- Choose in the popup menu to PASTE
- LINK create a result.rom file
- To test the rom file, click on "RUN" button

If all was going well, you must see your name at the menu screen

That's all! Good luck for your future ColecoVision projects!
