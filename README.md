# SPAZ ATTAK

This is (to be) a game for ColecoVision based off of Turmoil for the Atari 2600.

This is in progress.

I've included what I think to be necessary for this to be built and run, but no promises.

Also, you'll need to place a ColecoVision ROM in the z80/VCOLECO/ folder.

The game is in z80/Spaz/

The only restriction on re-use is that unHUman Software / Howard Uman must be credited on any title screen.
